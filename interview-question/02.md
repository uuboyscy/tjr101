# Kafka Pub/Sub System in Python

## Objective:
Build a simple, containerized pub/sub system using Kafka and Python, demonstrating key software
engineering skills within a limited timeframe. We will discuss your approach and design choices in detail
during the next interview. Est. 4-6 hours to finish.

## Problem:
Create a basic system with a data producer and a data consumer communicating through Kafka.
- Data Producer: Generate sample data and publish it to a Kafka topic.
- Data Consumer: Subscribe to the same Kafka topic and process/display the received data.

## Technical Requirements (needed but not limited to):
1. Kafka with Docker: Set up and run Kafka using Docker.
2. Python Applications: Implement producer and consumer in Python.
3. Containerized Applications: Containerize for your applications.
4. Enhance functionality, demonstrate best practices, or explore related concepts. Consider aspects
you might discuss in the interview.

## Submission:
1. GitHub Repo (Public): send the link to
2. Deadline: Submit the GitHub link within 2 days of receiving this email. (e.g., received Monday
morning, due by Wednesday at 11:59pm)

## Evaluation:
- Functionality and correctness of the pub/sub system.
- Code quality and design (clean code, architecture).
- Container integration and orchestration.
- Overall approach, reasoning behind design choices, and problem-solving.
- Demonstrated understanding of the code.
